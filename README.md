# image-caption
Experimented with using pretrained glove vectors instead of randomly initialized word embeddings to initialize the decoder in the show, attend and tell image captioning framework (https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044). Tensorflow implementation forked from https://github.com/yunjey/show-attend-and-tell-tensorflow.git
